As the iconic hero, Link, players traverse the familiar landscapes of Hyrule, now expanded to include two new regions—the sky, adorned with floating islands, and the Depths, an extensive underground realm beneath Hyrule. The game introduces Zonai devices, versatile tools utilized for combat, propulsion, exploration, and more. Departing from the previous runes, the game introduces five distinct abilities: Ultrahand, Fuse, Ascend, Recall, and Autobuild. Ultrahand empowers players to manipulate and combine objects, creating vehicles and structures with Zonai devices. Fuse allows Link to enhance weapons or shields by combining materials, adding unique attributes like explosive arrows. The Recall ability rewinds object movements, while Ascend enables vertical movement through solid surfaces. Autobuild simplifies crafting, instantly reconstructing Ultrahand-crafted devices, utilizing nearby materials. This imaginative blend of familiar Zelda elements and innovative mechanics promises an exhilarating and inventive gaming experience."
